# dataMink

Stratified datalog evaluation and SQL translation engine. Deductive database school project.

Based on mif37-dex (University Lyon 1) and using [Spring-shell](https://projects.spring.io/spring-shell/).


## Run

### Default engine

You can run all the engine by passing a file as parameter to the datamink binary.

```
java -jar datamink.jar yourFile
```
This will compute program type, stratification if needed, evaluation and sql translation.

### DataMink shell

DataMink provide a powerfull CLI runining on all good shells. To start the shell simply run datamink without any parameters.

```
java -jar datamink.jar yourFile
```

Once the shell is started, you have access to several commands.

- `help`: Show all available commands
- `dm load --file yourFile`: Pre-load a file on datamink engine
- `dm parse [file]`: Parse the given or pre-loaded datalog file and prints the result
- `dm prgm-type [file]`: Compute program type for the given or pre-loaded datalog file and prints the result
- `dm stratify [file]`: Stratify the given or pre-loaded datalog file and prints all stratums
- `dm eval [file]`: Compute evaluation for the given or pre-loaded datalog file and prints inferred facts
- `dm tosql [file]`: Translate the given or pre-loaded datalog file to SQL and prints the result
- `exit`: Leave the shell



## Datalog files

As datamink is based on mif37-dex, it handles datalog programs written as the following example.

```
EDB
link(Charpennes,Perrache) 
link(PartDieu,Charpennes) 
link(Debourg,PartDieu)
link(PartDieu,Debourg)

IDB
metro($x)
reachable($x,$y)
unreachable($x,$y)

MAPPING
link($x,$y) -> metro($x).
link($x,$y) -> metro($y).
link($x,$y) -> reachable($x,$y).
link($x,$z), reachable($z,$y) -> reachable($x,$y).
metro($x), metro($y), NEG reachable($x,$y) -> unreachable($x,$y).
```
